# Gomoku: Strategy Board Game

Welcome to my Gomoku project! Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. I created this web-based version using modern front-end technologies as a part of my portfolio.

## Features

This Gomoku game is not only interactive and responsive, but it's also built with the latest technologies. Here's what you can expect:

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Enjoy the traditional Gomoku game in a new, digital format. Play against AI or enjoy it with a friend.

- **Seamless Navigation:** Implemented with React Router v6, the navigation experience is seamless and user-friendly.

- **Responsive Design:** Built with mobile-first design principles, this game is fully responsive and provides a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **State Management:** Utilized React's Context API for efficient state management across the app.

- **Modern Build Tool:** The application is built using Vite, a next generation front-end build tool that offers faster and leaner development experiences.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/): Declarative routing for React.
- [SASS Modules](https://sass-lang.com/): CSS preprocessor for efficient styling.
- [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html): React's built-in state management method.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): Modern front-end build tool.

Feel free to explore the code to see how I put these technologies to use in creating this game!
